`biegunka` is command line tool to make working with __Biegunka__ scripts easier.

Before trying to use it, check if you have it in your `PATH`:

```shell
% which biegunka
/home/maksenov/.cabal/bin/biegunka
```

Output you'll receive should be similar.

Make sure you also have `makeOptionsParser ''Environments` in your scripts,
otherwise errors might be intimidating and cryptic.
